3. How the number of years in programming influence the preferred/mostly used language? This could be done using scatterplot or heatmaps... Mabye also have a look at Violin/Box Plots. Faceting? Adaptation of Univariate Plots? I can use the average of the years in programming on Y axis. This is qualitative (most used language) vs quantitative (number of years in programming)
4. Does the developer's principal language(s) influence the desire to learn a specific language in the future? This could be done usign scatterplot too? Maybe it is better to explore correlation with other features too.
