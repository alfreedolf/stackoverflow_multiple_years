## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow data from multiple years, from 2011, to better understand:

1. [What languages were the most popular in each year?](notebooks/1.LanguagesPopularityByYear.ipynb")
2. [What trends are in top 10 languages popularity?](notebooks/2.Top10LanguagesPopularityTrends.ipynb")
3. Does the country of origin influence the preferred/mostly used language?
4. Does the amount of years in programming influence the preferred/mostly used language?
5. Does the languages currently known by a developer influence the desire to learn a specific language in the future?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There will be 4 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.<br/>
Each of the notebooks will be exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the
notebook title.<br/>
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

There is an additional `.py` file that runs the necessary code to obtain the final model used to predict salary.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code will be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/TBD).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
